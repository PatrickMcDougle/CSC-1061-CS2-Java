# Grading

## How to lose 1 point per file per issue

-   **The header comment block is missing** - You must provide your name, date,
    course, and a short description. Optional items can be listed in the
    header comment block as well.
-   **Class comment block missing** - Every public class in the code needs a
    comment block discussing what the class does. What is the class' job?
-   **public method comment block missing** - Every public method in the code
    needs a comment block with a short description of what the method
    does, what the inputs/parameters are, what the method returns, and what
    exceptions it might throw.
-   **Using Swing or AWT** - Programs may require the use of a GUI. For that,
    JavaFX is the preferred method of doing GUIs. The use of AWT and Swing is
    discouraged for these are the old way of doing GUIs which comes with bugs
    and issues.
-   **My Opinion** - You may loose points on things that I feel you should loose
    points on. These tend to be the little random things I run into. This is a
    catch all statement for all those little things.

## How to lose partial points for a particular problem

-   **The code crashes during run time** - Ensure the code is tested and does
    not throw an exception (i.e., crashes). Except when the assignment is to do
    so.
-   **Failure to submit a project** - In other words, only the code was passed
    in without the project files.
-   **File and Class name don't match** - If the file name does not match the
    class name, the application will not run correctly.
-   **All Code in one file** - Multiple problems are put into one file. There
    should be at least one file per assignment problem. There could be multiple
    files for a particular problem.
-   **Missing Files** - all supporting files need to be submitted. I don't have
    the files you expect me to have. Your files may be different then mine. So,
    just to be safe, provide all the supporting files used for the assignment to
    make sure it works as you expect it to work.
-   **Method signature elements are not correct** - If the method name is not
    what is expected, or the inputs or outputs are different.
-   **Failing to follow assignment or problem instructions**
-   **Poor Coding**
-   **No GUI code** - missing GUI code for assignments that asked for it.
-   **Missing the point of the assignment**
-   **My Opinion** - Again a catch all.

## How to lose all the points for a particular problem

-   **The code is missing or not there** - If you create a class file that only
    has a class with no other methods or code, no points.
-   **The code crashes before anything is done** - The code compiles but
    initially throws an exception before any input is entered or output is
    presented.
-   **Submitting _.class_ files instead of the _.java_ files** - The _.java_
    files are the text files that we read and code in. The _.class_ files are
    the compiled bit code that the computer reads. I cannot read _.class_ files
    so I cannot grade the assignment.
-   **Only Submitting Screenshots** - I may ask for screenshots at the start of
    the semester (i.e. week 1 only). Submitting screenshots of your code is not
    passing in the code as a _.java_ file. I can not run the code in the
    screenshot, so I am unable to test the code.
-   **Code does not compile** - What is submitted should compile. No matter how
    much work is put into the assignment, if it does not compile, I cannot test
    the program's functionality.
-   **Submitting Project with a Build Agent** - building your project with Maven
    or Gradle (or any other build agent) will result in an automatic 0 points.
