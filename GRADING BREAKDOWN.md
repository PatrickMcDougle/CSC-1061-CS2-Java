# Grading

## How to lose 1 point per file per issue

-   **The header comment block is missing** - You must provide your name, date,
    course, and a short description. Optional items can be listed in the
    assignment.
-   **Class comment block missing** - Every public class in the code needs a
    comment block discussing what the class does. What is the class' job?
-   **Non-private method comment block missing** - Every non-public method in
    the code needs a comment block with a short description of what the method
    does, what the inputs/parameters are, what the method returns, and what
    exceptions it might throw.
-   **My Opinion** - You may loose points on things that I feel you should loose
    points on. These tend to be the little random things I run into.

## How to lose partial points for a particular problem

-   **The code crashes during run time** - Ensure the code is tested and does
    not throw an exception (i.e., crashes). Except when the assignment is to do
    so.
-   **Failure to submit a project** - In other words, only the code was passed
    in.
-   **File and Class name don't match** - If the file name does not match the
    class name, the application will not run correctly.
-   **All Code in one file** - Multiple problems are put into one file.
-   **Missing Files** - all supporting files need to be submitted. I don't have
    the files you expect me to have.

## How to lose all the points for a particular problem

-   **The code is missing or not there** - If you create a class file that only has
    a class with no other methods or code, no points.
-   **The code crashes before anything is done** - The code compiles but
    initially throws and exception before any input is entered.
-   **Submitting _.class_ files instead of the _.java_ files** - The _.java_
    files are the text files that we read and code in. The _.class_ files are
    the compiled bit code that the computer reads. I cannot read _.class_ files
    so I cannot grade the assignment.
-   **Only Submitting Screenshots** - I may ask for screenshots at the start of
    the semester (i.e. week 1 only). Submitting screenshots of your code is not
    passing in the code as a _.java_ file. I can not run the code in the
    screenshot, so I am unable to test the code.
-   **Code does not compile** - What is submitted should compile. No matter how
    much work is put into the assignment, if it does not compile, I cannot test
    the program's functionality.
-   **Submitting Project with a Build Agent** - building your project with Maven
    or Gradle will result in an automatic 0 points.
