# Grading

## How to lose 1 point per file per issue

- **The header comment block is missing** - You must provide your name, date, course, and a short description. Optional items can be listed in the assignment.
- **Class comment block missing** - Every public class in the code needs a comment block discussing what the class does. What is the class' job?
- **Non-private method comment block missing** - Every non-public method in the code needs a comment block with a short description of what the method does, what the inputs/parameters are, what the method returns, and what exceptions it might throw.

## How to lose partial points for a particular problem

- **The code crashes during run time** -  Ensure the code is tested and does not throw an exception (i.e., crashes). Except when the assignment is to do so.
- **Failure to submit a project** - In other words, only the code was passed in.

## How to lose all the points for a particular problem

- **Code is missing or not there** - If you create a class file that only has a class with no other methods or code, no points.
- **Submitting *.class* files instead of the *.java* files** - The *.java* files are the text files that we read and code in. The *.class* files are the compiled bit code that the computer reads. I cannot read *.class* files so I cannot grade the assignment.
- **Code does not compile** - What is submitted should compile.  No matter how much work is put into the assignment, if it does not compile, I cannot test the program's functionality.
