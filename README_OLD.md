# CSC-1061-CS2-Java

This repository of code is the code I use for my Arapahoe Community College's CSC 1061 course.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

| software | version |

| Java     | 17      |
| JavaFX   | 18.02   |

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders of importance, where:

-   `src`: the folder that contains the Java examples for each class/chapter
-   `resources`: the folder that contains resources needed for some of the examples

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
