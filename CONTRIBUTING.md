# How to contribute

## BLUF

Anyone and everyone is welcome to make changes to this repository.  Just create a Pull Request (PR) with your changes and submit the changes for review.  The PR will be reviewed, comments will be made, changes may be needed, and the change will be excepted or rejected.

## Testing

There is no testing framework used for this repository.  Testing is done by writting a test program that demonstrates the use of the code in question.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub PR for CSC 1061 CS2 Java repository](https://github.com/PatrickMcDougle/CSC-1061-CS2-Java/pulls) with a clear list of what has been done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow the coding conventions (below) and make sure things are commented where applicable.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

[Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it.

Dead code (code that is commented out) should be removed.  Unless used for teaching/learning purposes.

This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
