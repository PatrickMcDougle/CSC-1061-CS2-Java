With the Zentraedi menace ended—and that race's few survivors selfexiled on the factory satellite—humanity was free once more to wage war on itself. The so-named United Earth Government essentially served the needs of the Northlands and the sundry city- and nation-states that comprised the Western European Sector. Most non-allied regions had become self-sufficient and were loath to involve themselves in any global bureaucracy. Separatism prevailed. The thinking went that, should [the Masters or the Invid] arrive, the territory that played host to their planetfall would have the privilege or task of dealing with them. And so low-intensity conflicts flourished, particularly in the Southlands. Much as the Robotech Expeditionary Force had abandoned Earth, Anatole Leonard had abandoned the Southlands after parceling it up among his former lieutenants and cronies. By 2029, petty disputes between rival armies and polities had escalated to fullblown warfare. Dominique Duprey, Prelude to the Second Robotech War
